# Software Engineering Overview

## What is Software Engineering?
- Application of engineering principles to software development
- Systematic, disciplined approach to software production
- Focus on quality, reliability, maintainability

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- **Waterfall**: Sequential phases (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment)
- **Agile**: Iterative, incremental (Scrum, Kanban)
- **Spiral**: Risk-driven, prototyping
- **DevOps**: Integration of development and operations

## Key Principles
- **Modularity**: Divide into independent modules
- **Abstraction**: Hide complexity
- **Encapsulation**: Bundle data and behavior
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different aspects handled separately
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplication

## Software Quality Attributes
- **Functional**: Correctness, reliability
- **Non-functional**: Performance, usability, security, maintainability
- **External/Internal**: User-visible vs. developer-visible

## Metrics
- **Size**: LOC, function points
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity
- **Quality**: Defect density, MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)

## Challenges
- Requirements volatility
- Technology evolution
- Team coordination
- Legacy systems
